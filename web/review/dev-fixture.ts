  <ol>
    <li>The browser chooses uncommitted changes or the full branch.</li>
    <li>A private agent prepares this overview from the immutable patch.</li>
    <li>The loopback service serves the review and returns structured feedback.</li>

  <h2>Review focus</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Asset download and validation behavior across release and development builds.</li>
    <li>Diff scope semantics for tracked and untracked files.</li>
    <li>Whether submitted comments retain the correct file and line side.</li>
