//! Reusable authenticated server for shared Orvek memory.
//!
//! [MemoryServer] authenticates each request before binding its namespace to a concrete
//! [crate::MemoryStore]. It owns HTTP parsing, authorization, stable protocol errors, tracing,
//! request timeouts, and concurrency limits. Backend implementations own durable transactions,
//! indexing, capacity, telemetry, and stable export pagination.
//!
//! Production deployments can bind PlanetScale, Cloudflare, PostgreSQL, or another store through
//! the same [crate::MemoryStore] contract. The workspace's `orvek-memory-cloudflare` package
//! demonstrates a Cloudflare Worker backed by D1.
